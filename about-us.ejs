    <h3>About us</h3>
    <p>
      The Tibetan Scholarship Program Alumni Association (TSPAA) was established
      with the primary purpose of strengthening the network between all the
      cohorts of the Tibetan Scholarship Program (TSP), providing them a
      platform to reach out to their peers along with assisting them in their
      various social endeavors.
    </p>

    <p>
      With a cohort size exceeding 450 members, spread across more than thirty
      years, the TSP remains the most prestigious and influential scholarship
      for Tibetans, in India and Nepal, towards pursuing graduate studies in the
      United States.

      Those who have completed their graduation, as part of the TSP, bring with
      them various professional skill sets, experiences as well as a strong
      social commitment to the Tibetan society. The TSPAA comprises of all these
      incredible individuals who continue to contribute, innovatively, towards
      the welfare of the Tibetan diasporic community.
