              My typical day at work begins by watching and reading news of all the developments that have taken place in the last 12 hours, making a list of all the things that need to be done and a quick briefing with my colleagues on the work that needs to be done in the week or the day.
              I would develop story or content ideas, rewrite and edit scripts and supervise program production, ensuring adherence to deadlines and budget requirements in addition to administrative work daily while my weekly and monthly tasks include writing project proposals, following up on approvals, implementation, submitting monthly project reports and evaluating videos/films and edit manuscripts submitted for publication.

              My two years of working in the private airline sector with non-Tibetan colleagues made me realize the lack of purpose and the very little satisfaction in the work I was committed to despite excellent learning experiences and extremely helpful colleagues. It was right after completing my airline Load Control Officer’s training, that my best friend sent me the announcement from CTA on an upcoming staff recruitment exam. I took that as a sign to pursue the purpose I was looking for and started preparing for the exam. And here I am.
            </p>

            <p>
              My transfer to CTA’s media section prompted me to learn more about journalism and much more about world politics. To inform the world about Tibet and the Tibetan diaspora, I felt we needed to have adequate knowledge of the developments around the world. Without a theoretical background on the interactions of states in the global interstate system, I always found myself in doubt. That is why I sought to pursue my master’s in International Relations with Journalism as my elective.

              Being the only official media channel of the Central Tibetan Administration with about 236k followers on Facebook and 112k subscribers on YouTube, Tibet TV is more focused on ‘Getting It Right’ rather than ‘Getting It First’. Tibet TV focuses on providing authentic and accurate information and acts as a counterbalance to the influence of private media companies. Tibet TV provides coverage of events and issues that private media may not be interested in, such as stories related to government policies and actions.
Tibet TV’s weekly update in about 11 languages has been playing a pivotal role in informing Tibet supporters and non-Tibetan-speaking Tibetans worldwide on the latest developments in Tibet and CTA’s activities and by bringing all of them together under one umbrella when it comes to initiating Tibet advocacy activities and prioritizing agendas under the leadership of CTA.

          <p class="question">
            <span class="person">TSPAA:</span>  Given that you worked at TTV prior to leaving to pursue your graduate studies in the US, in what ways has your education in the US been beneficial in your current role?

              <span class="person">Chemey:</span>
              My two years of graduate studies were full of exposure to learning, unlearning, and contributing in many ways. Those experiences have not only made me more confident to work in the role I was assigned to but also helped me develop a better-informed mindset with a wider perspective towards all things in life and at work.

              I consider all the stories and interviews I work on equally significant since they are meant to disseminate information on the under-represented stories and under-reported cases of the human rights situation in Tibet, the developments in China, particularly related to Tibet, and CTA’s policies and programs. However, the stories and interviews we have covered during the COVID-19 pandemic have been extremely helpful for the viewers to cope with the uncertain times, particularly the interview with Kyabje Yonge Mingyur Rinpoche. The advice and perspectives Rinpoche gave me on life, work and the world during the interaction for the interviews were of immense help in overcoming many challenges I faced personally and professionally. I reflect on those time and again.

              Since its initial years in the 1980s, the Tibetan Scholarship Program has not only helped about 500 Tibetans realize their dreams of achieving new heights that people of displaced communities can only imagine. But also, built their capacities in ways that prepared them to uplift their community in all aspects. TSP scholars bring their unique experiences, perspectives, and cultural diversity to their host schools. Their presence, participation, and representation hold a great deal of significance for the under-represented exiled Tibetan community.
The Tibetan Scholarship Program awards the selected candidates. Nevertheless, it is not just a group of young Tibetans whose education is being facilitated, but the entire Tibetan community in exile that is being uplifted through them.
